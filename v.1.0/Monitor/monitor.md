Sysdig Monitor is part of Sysdig's cloud-native intelligence platform providing security, monitoring, cost-optimization, and forensics in a cloud and container-friendly architecture. Sysdig Monitor offers Kubernetes and cloud monitoring with a managed Prometheus service.

Sysdig Monitor is a monitoring, troubleshooting, cost-optimization, and alerting suite offering deep, process-level visibility into dynamic, distributed production environments. Sysdig Monitor captures, correlates, and visualizes full-stack data, and provides dashboards for monitoring your cloud-native environment.

In the background, the Sysdig agent lives on the hosts being monitored and collects the appropriate metrics and events. Out of the box, the agent reports on a wide variety of pre-defined metrics. Additional metrics and custom parameters are available via agent configuration files and Monitoring and Cloud Integrations.

This topic outlines the different use cases for Sysdig Monitor and necessary direction to get you started.
